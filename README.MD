# psh ![CI](https://github.com/pascal-zarrad/psh/workflows/CI/badge.svg?branch=main)
psh - which stands for Pascal's Shell is a configuration tool for zsh.
It is a composition of the finest plugins and a nice looking theme (currently it is one bundled with oh-my-zsh)
that helps myself and hopefully also others to grow their productivity by customizing their shell experience.

This installer enables the fast installation of zsh, zplug, oh-my-zsh and other plugins that provide a great zsh experience.
The installer generates always a custom .zshrc which can be modified by adding own customizations to the plugins folder.
To make customizations even easier, psh has a template system that allows the import of personalized .zshrc snippets that are composed together
and inserted into the generated configuration!

It was never that easy and therefore fast to install a customized shell than with psh - and with some knowledge about shell scripting with bash/zsh,
you will be able to implement everything you could imagine in a configuration for zsh.

> Why psh if I could just use zplug?
>
> Firstly, psh is pre-configured in a way that is already quite powerful.
> The target of the default configuration is to make shell enjoyable and move people
> to prefer shell over GUI.
>
> Secondly, psh takes care of dependencies. You setup your new os, clone this repository
> and run the `install.sh` script. If your system is supported, psh installs
> everything necessary - from zsh to git or curl.
> After the install script, your zsh is ready to go.

![PSH Installer](https://github.com/pascal-zarrad/psh/raw/master/.github/MEDIA/psh.gif)

The targets of psh are:
 * Create a great zsh experience out of the box
 * Automate and simplify installation by using an installer
 * Be extendable for forks and own variations of the installer

## What is used
You can find a list of used frameworks and plugins in the wiki under [Technologies](https://github.com/pascal-zarrad/psh/wiki/Technologies).

## Compatibility
In theory all configuration done by psh should work on any system that is compatible with zsh and all dependencies
that are used to enhance the zsh experience. However, due to package management, not all operating systems are supported.

Currently psh is only tested in the following environments:
 * Arch Linux
 * Manjaro Linux
 * Ubuntu
 * Debian
 * PopOs!
 * Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL2)

psh is is only tested on the current OS releases when a release is made.
If you want to be sure, test psh in a virtual machine before installing it.

You can find further information in the wiki under [Compatibility](https://github.com/pascal-zarrad/psh/wiki/Compatibility).

## Installation

The installation is documented in the wiki under [Installation](https://github.com/pascal-zarrad/psh/wiki/Installation).

## Updating
