# psh

psh - which stands for Pascal's Shell is a configuration for zsh that I use on a daily basis. It is a composition of the finest plugins and a nice looking theme (currently it is one bundled with oh-my-zsh) that help myself and hopefully also others to grow their productivity.

The two targets of psh are:
 * Create a great zsh experience out of the box
 * Automate and simplify installation by using an installer
 * Be extendable for forks and own variations of the installer

## Compatibility
In theory all configuration done by psh should work on any system that is compatible with zsh and all dependencies that are used to enhance the zsh experience.
But as the installer uses ```apt```, you need any system that supports ```apt``` to use it.

Currently psh is onyl tested in the following environments:
 * Ubuntu 18.04 (Windows Subsystem for Linux 1)

## Installation

psh is being installed using an install script that will guide you through the installation process of zsh and all required dependencies. Finally the installer will do all required configuration tasks to get a great experience out of zsh without manual configuration.

## Contributing

You are welcome to contribute to psh if you have improvements or bug fixes.
You are also welcome to suggest own plugins that should be added to the default
psh installation. As this is the configuration I use every day, not every plugin suggestion will be accepted,
but I try to be open regarding contributions.
